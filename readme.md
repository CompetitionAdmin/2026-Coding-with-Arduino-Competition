# Coding with Arduino Software Engineering Competition

Use this Git repo to upload your teams code so that our judges can review it prior to the competition.  This can be done by creating a branch and then uploading your code to your newly created branch.  When naming your branch please use this format: {SchoolName}_{TeamName}

For example: <b>AcmePublicSchools_RabidVipers</b>

At the top of your source code please include comments that include your school name, your teachers name, and the names of each student on your team in addition to the grade they are in.
